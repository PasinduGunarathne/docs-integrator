# Design Logic

Design the behavior of your integrations — the logic that runs when a request arrives, an event fires, or a schedule triggers. WSO2 Integrator gives you two complementary approaches: a visual flow designer for rapid development and a full code editor for advanced scenarios. Both views stay synchronized, so you can switch freely between them.

## Approaches to designing logic

| Approach | Best for | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| **[Visual Flow Designer](visual-flow-designer.md)** | Most integration scenarios, visual thinkers, rapid prototyping | Click on any automation, handler, or function in the sidebar |
| **[Ballerina Pro-Code](ballerina-pro-code.md)** | Complex algorithms, advanced concurrency, custom protocols | Edit `.bal` files directly |
| **Hybrid** | Start visual, switch to code for specific blocks | Use both views side-by-side |

## Core concepts

Every integration follows a similar pattern: receive input, process it through a series of steps, and produce output. The design logic tools help you define those steps.

The building blocks of integration logic include:

- **[Connections](managing-connections.md)** — Connect to databases, APIs, brokers, and cloud services
- **[Control Flow](control-flow.md)** — Branch, loop, and match on conditions
- **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** — Handle failures with do/on-fail, retry, and fallback
- **[Expressions](expressions.md)** — Transform data inline with the Ballerina expression language
- **[Query Expressions](query-expressions.md)** — Filter, transform, and aggregate collections with SQL-like syntax
- **[Configuration](configuration-management.md)** — Externalize settings for different environments
- **[Functions](functions.md)** — Extract and reuse common logic
- **[Java Interoperability](java-interoperability.md)** — Call Java libraries from your integrations

## Quick example

Click **Automation** (or any handler) in the **Entry Points** section of the WSO2 Integrator sidebar to open the flow canvas.

![Flow canvas showing the Automation with Start node, action buttons, and Flow/Sequence tabs](/img/develop/design-logic/flow-designer/canvas-overview.png)

The canvas opens with a **Start** node and an **+** button. Click **+** to open the step picker and add nodes — connections, control flow, transformations, and error handling — to build your integration visually.

Here is a complete integration that receives an HTTP request, validates the payload, calls an external API, transforms the result, and returns a response:

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

configurable string crmEndpoint = ?;
final http:Client crmClient = check new (crmEndpoint);

type ContactRequest record {|
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    string email;
|};

type ContactResponse record {|
    string id;
    string fullName;
    string email;
    string createdAt;
|};

service /api on new http:Listener(8090) {

    resource function post contacts(ContactRequest req)
            returns ContactResponse|http:BadRequest|error {
        // 1. Validate
        if req.email == "" || !req.email.includes("@") {
            return <http:BadRequest>{body: {message: "Invalid email address"}};
        }

        // 2. Transform for external API
        json crmPayload = {
            first_name: req.firstName,
            last_name: req.lastName,
            email_address: req.email
        };

        // 3. Call external system
        json crmResponse = check crmClient->post("/contacts", crmPayload);

        // 4. Transform response
        return {
            id: check crmResponse.id,
            fullName: req.firstName + " " + req.lastName,
            email: req.email,
            createdAt: check crmResponse.created_at
        };
    }
}
```
