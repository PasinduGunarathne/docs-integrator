# Connectors Overview

Send a Slack notification when an order ships. Read customer records from Salesforce. Write results to a Google Sheet. Query a database and return the data in an API response.

Connectors make these integrations possible—without writing low-level HTTP or protocol code. WSO2 Integrator includes 200+ pre-built connectors for the services your business already uses.

## How connectors fit into your integration

Every integration in WSO2 Integrator follows the same pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Trigger])

    A --> B

    B["Transform & route
    (map, filter, branch)"]

    B --> C

    subgraph connector["Connector"]
        C["Connector action
        (call external service)"]
    end

    C --> D

    D["Handle response
    (error handling, retry)"]

    D --> E([Output])

    style A fill:#EEEDFE,stroke:#534AB7,color:#3C3489
    style B fill:#F1EFE8,stroke:#5F5E5A,color:#444441
    style C fill:#FAECE7,stroke:#993C1D,color:#712B13
    style D fill:#F1EFE8,stroke:#5F5E5A,color:#444441
    style E fill:#E1F5EE,stroke:#0F6E56,color:#085041
    style connector fill:#fafafa,stroke:#cbd5e1,stroke-dasharray:5 5,color:#64748b
```

The connector action is where WSO2 Integrator communicates with the external service.

## Key concepts

### Connector

A connector is a pre-built integration component (implemented as a Ballerina package) that wraps an external service's API into ready-to-use operations. Instead of constructing HTTP requests and parsing responses by hand, you select an action from the connector's list and configure its inputs.

### Connection

A connection is a named, reusable configuration that holds the credentials and endpoint settings for an external service—API keys, OAuth tokens, hostnames. You define it once; every action in your integration uses it by name.

For details on creating and managing connections, see [Connections](../develop/integration-artifacts/supporting/connections.md).

### Action

An action is a specific operation you invoke through a connection—"send SMS", "create contact", "execute query". Each connector exposes a list of available actions. Actions are outbound: your integration calls the external service.

### Trigger

Some connectors also support triggers—inbound events the external service pushes into your integration. A database trigger fires when a row changes. A messaging trigger fires when a new message arrives.

| | Actions | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| Direction | Your integration calls the service | The service calls your integration |
| Example | Send an SMS, create a Salesforce record | New database row, incoming webhook |

Most connectors are action-only. Trigger support is available for select connectors—primarily databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL), messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file storage. See each connector's documentation for what's available.

## Libraries without client connectors

In addition to standard connectors that provide client implementations, WSO2 Integrator also includes libraries that do not expose client connectors but still provide useful integration capabilities.

### Examples

- PDF operations
- String manipulation
- I/O operations
- AWS Lambda integration
- Azure Functions

### Usage

These libraries are typically used within integration flows for internal processing, data transformation, or invoking external services without requiring a dedicated client connector.

### Considerations

- These libraries may require additional configuration depending on the deployment environment
- They are often used alongside connectors in more complex integration scenarios
