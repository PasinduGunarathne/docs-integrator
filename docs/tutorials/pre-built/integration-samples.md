# Pre-Built Integration Samples

Ready-to-run integration samples built with Ballerina that connect popular SaaS applications, databases, and messaging systems. Each sample is a complete, working project that you can clone from GitHub, add your credentials, and run immediately.

These samples are sourced from the [Ballerina Integrator](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-integrator) project and demonstrate real-world integration scenarios that you can customize and extend.
