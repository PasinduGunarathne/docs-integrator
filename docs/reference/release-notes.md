### Known issues

- GraalVM native image compilation may require additional configuration for some connector packages. Check the connector documentation for GraalVM compatibility before enabling native builds.
- The visual designer does not yet support `worker` message passing constructs. These are displayed as code blocks in the flow diagram.
- Hot reload during `bal run` may not detect changes to platform JAR dependencies. Restart the application after updating JARs in the `libs/` directory.
- The `bal persist` tool does not yet support all data store types in migration mode. Check the [persist documentation](https://ballerina.io/learn/bal-persist-overview) for supported stores.

### Breaking changes

This is the first GA release of WSO2 Integrator. There are no breaking changes from prior versions.

WSO2 Integrator is a new Ballerina-based product alongside the existing WSO2 MI. If you are an existing MI user, your current deployments continue to work and MI remains fully supported. See the [MI documentation](https://mi.docs.wso2.com) for MI-specific guidance.

### Coming from WSO2 MI?

If you are considering adopting WSO2 Integrator for new projects or migrating existing MI integrations, see the [Coming from WSO2 MI](/docs/tutorials/migration/from-wso2-mi) guide. The two products use different development approaches:

| Aspect | WSO2 MI | WSO2 Integrator |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Configuration language | XML (Synapse) | Ballerina |
| Development model | XML artifacts | Code-first with visual designer |
| Deployment unit | CAR file | Executable JAR / Docker image |
| Runtime | Java/OSGi | Ballerina/JVM |
| Mediators | XML mediator sequence | Ballerina functions |
| Connectors | Synapse connectors | Ballerina Central packages |
| Registry | Carbon registry | Config.toml / environment variables |
