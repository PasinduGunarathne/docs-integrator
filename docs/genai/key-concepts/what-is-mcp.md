# What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how AI assistants discover and interact with external tools, data sources, and services. Think of MCP as a universal adapter between AI and enterprise systems.

Instead of building custom integrations for each AI assistant, you publish an MCP server once and any MCP-compatible client can use it.

## Why MCP?

Before MCP, connecting AI assistants to enterprise data required custom code for each client. MCP standardizes this with a single protocol:

- **Claude Desktop** can query your CRM
- **GitHub Copilot** can access your internal APIs
- **Custom agents** can use community MCP servers for Slack, GitHub, and file systems

All through the same protocol, with no client-specific code.

## How MCP works

    Client["MCP Client<br/>(AI Assistant)<br/>Claude Desktop<br/>GitHub Copilot<br/>Custom Agent"]
    Server["MCP Server<br/>(Your Service)<br/>WSO2 Integrator<br/>Functions, APIs<br/>Databases, etc."]

    Client <==> |MCP Protocol| Server
```

1. **Discovery** -- The client connects and asks the server what tools, resources, and prompts are available
2. **Invocation** -- The client calls a tool or reads a resource with structured parameters
3. **Response** -- The server executes the request and returns results
4. **Context** -- The AI assistant incorporates the results into its reasoning

## MCP capabilities

MCP defines three types of capabilities:

| Capability | Description | Direction |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Tools** | Functions the AI can call with parameters and receive results | AI calls your code |
| **Resources** | Read-only data the AI can access for context | AI reads your data |
| **Prompts** | Pre-defined prompt templates the AI can use | AI uses your templates |

## MCP in WSO2 Integrator

WSO2 Integrator supports MCP in two directions:

### As an MCP server

Expose your integrations as tools that AI assistants can discover and call.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/mcp;

@mcp:Tool {
    name: "getOrderStatus",
    description: "Look up the status of a customer order by order ID"
}
isolated function getOrderStatus(string orderId) returns json|error {
    return check orderApi->get(string `/orders/${orderId}/status`);
}
```

### As an MCP client

Consume external MCP tools from within your agents.

```ballerina
final mcp:Client githubMcp = check new ({
    serverCommand: "npx",
    serverArgs: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
});

final agent:ChatAgent myAgent = check new (
    model: llmClient,
    systemPrompt: "You are a development assistant.",
    tools: check githubMcp.getTools()
);
```

## Transport options

| Transport | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **stdio** | Local MCP clients like Claude Desktop |
| **SSE** | Remote or web-based clients |
| **Streamable HTTP** | Modern HTTP with streaming support |
